<!--OUR ETHOS OF CARE:

We believe healing, transformation and commitment to The Community Good begins with being aware:

With awareness we can expand and deepen our capacity to care; 

With care comes connection and relationship;

With relationship comes the opportunity to see truth and build trust;

With trust comes heartfelt compassion and empathy;

With compassion and empathy come justice and healing;

With justice and healing comes peace;

With PEACE we can create meaningful, joyful sustainable lives, communities and societies.

BUT, FIRST, WE MUST CARE.

 

The path to cultural transformation begins with Care:  Caring about, in order to care for and, ultimately, care with one another. We care about the well-being of Humanity and all life on this planet, as well as the Earth herself.

While we may focus our energy and resources on one specific issue — or a certain approach to an issue — we acknowledge the importance of and need for other members’ work and support them as we are able. At the very least, we care about the issue and will not stand in the way of any nonviolent approach.

Caring is not a competition.

Only when we genuinely care can collaboration be transformative — and sustainable.

What might our world look like if caring values were embraced and acted upon by more individuals, enterprises, organizations and institutions, with a dedication to Community Good?

What if we could change everything by having the courage to ask “What If”?

Imagine the potential transformation toward justice, equity and harmony in our culture, civic life, economic activities, and the environment.

Joining The Coalition for Good is one action which puts us on a path of toward a new way of doing and being; a path which runs parallel and collaborates with many other efforts which are aligned with and supportive of individual and systemic transformative healing; a restoration and rejuvenation of Our Community Good. 


WHAT’S “GOOD”?

We define the ultimate Good as a world where no one is The Other and Everyone Belongs. The Coalition for Good (CfG) is a membership alliance of individuals, networks, organizations and businesses united by our values and vision which benefit the Common Good. 

Dedication to the Common Good and the transformation we need won’t happen without a commitment to inclusivity + belonging. Diversity isn’t enough. Being “not racist” isn’t enough. It’s time to take a definitive stance, not only for inclusivity, diversity and belonging but against racism, white supremacy and the many manifestations of bigotry. 

It’s time for moral courage. A clear, visible Anti-Black Racism + Anti-Indigenous Racism + Anti-POC Racism + Anti-Othering position is vital. 

A world with more caring, just|equitable, inclusive and thus sustainable communities and societies is our vision. We want the planet to be a No-Othering Zone. Our mission is to facilitate cultural, systemic transformation toward our shared vision via creation of collaborative spaces, platforms and projects. 

Doing the work to create spaces and systems that are founded upon genuine care for one another and a commitment to Anti-Racism + Anti-Othering is our priority. 

We’re like a Chamber of Commons, building an Ecosystem for Good.

The Coalition for Good shall guide the way to that more caring, just, inclusive world, led by those who have been most impacted by racism and othering.-->
